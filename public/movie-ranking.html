<h3>CHEETAH GIRLS</h3>
<p>This movie will always be the best, <br/> The music,<br /> The drama,<br /> The sass <br/>
I love it! <br/>
</p>

<h3>SOUND OF MUSIC</h3>
<p>I just love the whole story behind it, 
I particularly love all the songs the children sing, and I love the relationship between her and the father. </p>

<h3>A CINDERALLA STORY</h3>
<p>Call me biased but this is the best cinderalla story made TO DATE.I love everything about it.<br/> Something about it just makes my heart flutter, I am a sucker for period dramas.</p>
